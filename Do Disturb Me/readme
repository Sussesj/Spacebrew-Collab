Assignment 1: Disturb Me!

Imagine you are sitting in a coffee shop and you want to alert your 
friend walking in if you would like to talk or if you are busy. 
You can use this app to let your friend know, and you can see their 
alert as to whether they want to be disturbed or not too!

We created this app with two people in mind, but it would be great 
to get more people involved. In this case, there might be a problem 
identifying which person does or does not want to be disturbed. Therefore, 
our idea is to create another output using arduino, so that there will be 
an alert light which shows your friend red if you do not want to be disturbed, 
and green if you do. This light is portable and attaches to a cup you are drinking from.
